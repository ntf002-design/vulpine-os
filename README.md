# BlueBuild Base Images Repo

This repo consists of base images maintained by the BlueBuild org and built with the BlueBuild CLI. These images come with batteries included and were modeled after the [Ublue Main Images](https://github.com/ublue-os/main) before they were reduced in scope. Thanks to [Ublue](https://universal-blue.org/) for giving us a good starting point!

## Installation

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  bootc switch ghcr.io/blue-build/base-images/fedora-kinoite:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/blue-build/base-images/fedora-kinoite:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/blue-build/base-images/fedora-base:latest
```

## Migration from Ublue Base images

We sign the kernel and kernel modules with our own key, so moving directly to a `bluebuild` base image will require trusting our key on your machine. You can easily curl our public key and use `mokutil` to trust it by doing the following:

```bash
key=$(mktemp)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/blue-build/base-images/raw/refs/heads/main/files/base/etc/pki/akmods/certs/akmods-blue-build.der -o "$key"

# Input your own password that you will use for verifying.
# The password is only for the user's purpose to know they are enrolling the correct key on boot.
sudo mokutil --import "$key"
```

Then you can reboot, enroll the key before the os starts up, and enter the password you entered during the `mokutil` import for trusting the key. Then you can update your recipe to use any of our base images or switch directly to a base image without running into any secure boot issues. This will NOT remove any other trusted key including the Ublue keys that you have.
